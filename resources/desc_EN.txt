[b]Random Note[/b] - Add randomness on note parameters. The "static" mode applies a fixed random number (eg a detuned instrument), while the "dynamic" mode recomputes the random number each time (eg a bad musician)

[b]Random Play[/b] - A random arpeggiator. Useful for creating FX, ambient noise. Can be associated with the script "Random Note".

[b]Fix Overlaps[/b] - Maintains consistency between "note on" and "note off". This script ensures that two notes with the same pitch will never overlap.

[b]Mapper[/b] - Map the desired control: Velocity, midi cc, etc ... Can be used to limit the velocity, making it soft, hard, or constant, reverse a midi cc.

[b]Delay[/b] - A simple delay in ms.

[img]http://louiscouka.com/img/scripts/delay.png[/img]

All these scripts are loaded into a rack of type "Event", "+" button and "Script Processor" submenu.
